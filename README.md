# US Economic Data Analysis
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that visually analyze US Economic data as provided by [St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org).
The analysis is carried out using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [Pandas datareader](https://pydata.github.io/pandas-datareader/).

So far I created the following notebooks:
* [Analysis of evolution of the seasonally adjusted CPI and Fed Funds Effective Rate](./CPI_and_Fed_Funds_Rates.ipynb)
* [Analysis of evolution of the US Federal Public Debt as percentage of GDP as well as as percentage of Federal annual tax revenue](./Fed_Public_Debt_and_Fed_Tax_Revenue.ipynb)
